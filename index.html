    <p class="paragraph">Hello, I'm Nabi Habib, a passionate Software Engineer based in San Diego, CA. With a B.S. in Computer Engineering from San Diego State University, I'm dedicated to creating innovative software solutions that make a difference.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">During my recent internship at Bolt Medical, I collaborated across cross-functional teams, including software (front end, back end, and embedded systems). I enhanced Gen1 and Gen2 machine functionality, ensuring reliability and consistency through rigorous testing. My attention to detail also contributed to validating critical test procedures and reports. In addition, I conducted 1000 durability tests on the Gen2 machine's display and assisted in updating Gen2 machine risk assessments.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">I also gained valuable experience during my internship at Recon RF, where I conducted load pulls on transistors to find the optimum power and efficiency. I also calibrated semiconductor test stations, further honing my technical skills.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">My technical toolkit includes languages like C++, JavaScript, and Matlab, and I'm proficient in NodeJS and React. I thrive on tackling diverse software challenges, from front-end user experiences to optimizing system performance on the back end.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">If you're seeking a versatile Software Engineer who's ready to take on new opportunities and contribute to your projects, let's connect! Please reach out if you'd like to discuss how I can be an asset to your team.</p>
